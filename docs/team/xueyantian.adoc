== PROJECT: TheTracker (v1.4)

---

== Overview

TheTracker is a desktop address book application that helps NUS students to monitor contacts, modules and events.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: extended AddCommand to *AddPersonCommand, AddModuleCommand, AddOccasionCommand*
** What it does: allows the user to adds Person, Module, and Occasion to their own TheTracker. Any Persons, Modules and
Occasions added by users in the command line will show in separate windows. It also allows users to input only one
compulsory attribute to add one Person, Module or Occasion.
** Justification: These features is the basics of the product such that a user can track his or her contacts, modules
and occasions happening in the school. It is more convenient for the users to input any number of optional attributes
when they are adding the Person, Module and Occasion, and to update these optional attributes at any time they feel
needed, rather than requiring the users to input all the attributes at the first place.

* *Major enhancement*: extended FindCommand to *FindPersonCommand, FindModuleCommand, FindOccasionCommand*
** What it does: allows the user to finds Person by name, phone, or email, address, modules they are taking, and
occasions they are involved in; similarly, it allows finding Modules by module code, module name, academic year or
semester; finding occasions by occasion name, occasion date, or occasion location.
** Justification: These features largely improve the convenience for finding a specific Person, Module or Occasion. For
instance, a Person now can be found by his or her name, phone, email, address, module code of the module he is taking,
and occasion name of the occasion he is involved in. Multiple steps of findperson command
can be used to find a person by more than one kind of conditions.
** Highlights: The finding is based on the prefixes entered by the user when he or she adds a Person, Module
or Occasion. It is compatible with the Add Command, such that Person, Module and Occasion will only be found by the
attributes that have been entered by the user.
* *Minor enhancement*: built tests for Occasion related classes, and unit and system tests for the above-mentioned
commands.
