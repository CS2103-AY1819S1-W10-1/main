== PROJECT: TheTracker (v1.4)

---

== Overview

This Project Portfolio details my contributions to TheTracker.
It demonstrates my ability to contribute as a team member of a software engineering project in both technical and non-technical ways.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: *Improved `delete` function to properly delete any type of entry*
** Description: Allows the user to delete a person, module or occasion by index. It also removes this entry from all other linked entries.
** Importance: This feature makes it easy for a user to remove any unnecessary entries from TheTracker.
It also saves users from manually removing the entry from all associated entries.
** Highlights: This enhancement required deletion from the three lists to be handled independently, but with entries in all lists being updated.
This was challenging to implement as it required new objects to be create and linked in order for the undo/redo operations to work.

* *Minor enhancement*: Improved `select` function to handle the three lists
** Description: Allows the user to select an entry from the active list, and view additional info
** Importance: The implementation is symmetric across all 3 lists, so that the user does not need to use different commands for different lists.

* *Code Contributed*: https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=waytan[Link to Code Contributions]

* *Other contributions*:

** Conceptualization:
*** Suggested context-inferring commands (e.g. `select`, `delete` instead of `selectmodule, `deletemodule`)
*** Suggested implementing `insertperson` and `removeperson` to link persons with modules/occasions
** Project management:
*** Involved in distributing roles and consolidating tasks
*** Manage Issue Tracker for v1.3, v1.4
** Community:
*** PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W10-1/main/pull/81[#81], https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W10-1/main/pull/87[#87]
*** Helped in identifying bugs and offered suggestions for debugging
** Documentation:
*** Wrote user stories, use cases for v1.0
*** Updated description of user guide to match application design
** Key Code Components
*** Set up module class, various components and their unit tests.
*** Set up test utils for modules and occasions: https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W10-1/main/pull/97[#97], https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W10-1/main/pull/109[#109]
