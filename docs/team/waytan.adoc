== PROJECT: TheTracker (v1.3)

---

== Overview

The Tracker (v1.3) is a desktop application that helps NUS students to monitor contacts, modules and events.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: *improved existing delete function to delete any type of entry*
** What it does: allows the user to delete a person, module or occasion by index
** Justification: This feature is necessary for a user to simultaneously maintain all three types of entries.
