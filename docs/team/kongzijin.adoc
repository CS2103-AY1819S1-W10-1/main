== PROJECT: TheTracker (v1.4)

---

== Overview

The Tracker (v1.4) is a desktop application that helps NUS students to monitor contacts, modules and events.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*:
** Improved existing edit function to edit any type of entry.
*** What it does: allows the user to edit a person, module or occasion by index
*** Justification: This is one of the basic features of TheTracker, which allows a user to edit module and occasion in a
similar way of how he edit a person in his address book.
*** Highlights: This feature is necessary for a user to simultaneously maintain all three types of entries.
*** Credits: This enhancement requires the different lists to be handled independently, but with all actions tracked simultaneously (e.g. for undo/redo).

** Create the export function
*** What it does: allows the user to export user data to a specified file type at a specified location.
*** Highlights: This feature enhance user's experience to TheTracker. He can now raise a data communication (with import feature in coming v2.0) with the external world.
*** Credits: This enhancement requires the command to access storage access directly, and has restrictions on the file path user typed in.
