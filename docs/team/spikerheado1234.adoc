== Overview

TheTracker is an application specifically built for NUS students. Allowing a student to keep track of his/her own occasions, modules and keep up to date with his/her friends.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the multi-panel UI*
** What it does: Allows the user to switch in between module, person and occasion tabs. To allow a user to, conveniently, his/her modules and occasions.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as the user can now conveniently have a consolidated place where he/she can find information on his existing modules and occasions.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. As they must have to ability to render changes to this new UI. The implementation was also extremely challenging as the underlying structure of the previous UI had to be changed significantly.
** Credits: _{All abstractions, logic was conceived of solely by me, whilst the design of the new UI was a group effort}_

* *Minor enhancement*: Designed and implemented the new Tagging System that uses a dynamic key/value mapping enabling the user to find by certain attributes.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W10-1/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W10-1/main/blob/master/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/MainMenuHandle.java[Test code]]

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The `MainWindow` is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.
