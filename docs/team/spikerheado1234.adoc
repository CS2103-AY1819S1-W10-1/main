== PROJECT: AddressBook - Level 4

---

== Overview

TheTracker is an application specifically built for NUS students. Allowing a student to keep track of his/her own occasions, modules and keep up to date with his/her friends.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: implemented *the insertperson feature with UI components*
** What it does: Allows the user to build an association between a person and a module, or a person and an occasion.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as the user can now conveniently register his/her associated persons with modules and occasions. This makes TheTracker more of a holistic and useful product.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects the existing delete and edit commands as now an edit to an entity must edit all the entities associated with it as well.
** Credits: _{All abstractions, logic was conceived of solely by me}_

* *Minor enhancement*: Added the new UI panels to display the contents of modules and occasions.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=spikerheado1234&sort=displayName&since=2018-09-12&until=2018-11-12&timeframe=day&reverse=false&repoSort=true[Contributed Code]]

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:

*** Managed releases `v1.1` - `v1.2` (2 releases) on GitHub
*** Managed Pull Request to upstream CS2103 Main Repo for assessment by tutors.
***
** Tools:
*** Integrated Travis CI into the repo.

=== Inserting a Person: `insertperson`

==== Inserting a person into a module: `insertperson`
Builds an association between a module and a person within `TheTracker` by inserting
a `person` bi-directionally into a `module`.

Format: +
`insertperson pi/PERSON_INDEX mi/MODULE_INDEX`

Example:

* `insertperson pi/1 mi/1` Builds an association between the first `person` and `module` by inserting `person` 1 bi-directionally
into `module` 1.

==== Inserting a person into an occasion: `insertperson`
Builds an association between an occasion and a person within `TheTracker` by inserting
a `person` bi-directionally into an `occasion`.

Format: +
`insertperson pi/PERSON_INDEX oi/OCCASION_INDEX`

Example:

* `insertperson pi/1 oi/1` Builds an association between the first `person` and `occasion` by inserting `person` 1 bi-directionally
into `occasion` 1.

=== InsertPerson feature
The `InsertPerson` command is an advanced feature for TheTracker. It enables a bi-directional insert of a Person into
either one of a `module` or an `occasion`.

====  Current Implementation
To enable this feature to exist, the underlying structure between the entities `Person`, `Module` and `Occasion` have to
be linked in a manner that will facilitate injections of one entity bi-directionally into another. The following class diagram
depicts this new structure:

image::PersonModuleOccasionClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

For the following example we will use `InsertPerson` command to insert a `person`, bi-directionally, into a `module`.
The usage for a bi-directional insert into an `occasion` is similar.

`InsertPerson` command extends the `Command` class and uses inheritance to facilitate implementation. It's mechanism is
facilitated by `VersionAddressBook`. Below is the associated sequence diagram for the `InsertPerson` command:

image::InsertPersonSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

When the user first opens up `TheTracker` it loads up an instance of a `VersionAddressBook` and initializes
the `currentStatePointer` to point at this instance of the `TheTracker`. When the user then executes the `InsertPerson`
command an entirely new copy of the state of `TheTracker` is created and inserted as a new `VersionAddressBook` with the
currentStatePointer being updated. Below is a diagram that depicts this:

image::InsertPersonStatePointerDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following steps represent the internal implementation of the `InsertPerson` command when inserting a `Person` into a `Module`:

* Create a `DeepDuplicate` and a `ShallowDuplicate` of the Both the `Person` and the `Module`
* Insert the `ShallowDuplicate` of the module into the `DeepDuplicate` of the `Person's` `UniqueModuleList`
* Insert the `ShallowDuplicate` of the person into the `DeepDuplicate` of the `Module's` `UniquePersonsList`

Note: Further elaboration of the above implementation is discussed within the `Design Considerations` section.

==== Design Considerations

Why it is non-trivial:

* For the feature to work coherently with `undo`/`redo` as well as `edit` an entire new replica of state
of `TheTracker` must be created with the relevant entities bi-directionally inserted after this command has been executed.
In accordance with this logic, two such methods were introduced to facilitate this feature's functionality. The first is
the method `makeDeepDuplicate`, the following class diagram shows how the method works in relation to calling `makeDeepDuplicate`
on a person:

image::PersonMakeDeepDuplicate.png[width="800"]

The method merely makes an entirely new copy of a `Person`/`Module`/`Occasion` by copying by `value` all of its predecessor's
attributes. We cannot, however, make do with only `makeDeepDuplicate` in order to implement the `InsertPerson` feature.
The following scenario illustrates why:

* Insertion of `Person` `x` into `Occasion` `y` would cause `x's` occasion list to be populated by `y` and `y's` person list
to be populated by `x`
* Insertion of `Person` `x` into `Module` `z` would cause `x's` module list to be populated by `z` and `z's` person list
to be populated by `x`. But if we insert a deep copy of `x` into `z` this would entail us replicating `y`, which would entail
us replicating the person list of `y` and, thus, `x` and so the program will halt in an infinite regress until a
`StackOverFlow` is thrown.

To counter this, we have implemented a `makeShallowDuplicate` which replicates an entity, but with an empty list. For example,
calling `makeShallowDuplicate` on a `Person` would have the following effect:

image::PersonMakeShallowDuplicate.png[width="800"]

Upon insertion of a `Module` into a `Person` the respective `Module's` `ShallowDuplicate` is inserted to avoid this
error.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The `MainWindow` is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.
